# ESP32 Web Server with DHT Sensor

Welcome to the ESP32 Web Server with DHT Sensor project! This project showcases how to set up an ESP32 microcontroller as a web server to display real-time temperature and humidity readings from a DHT11. The web page automatically updates without the need for manual refreshing.

## Features

- ESP32-based web server.
- Integrated DHT11for temperature and humidity measurements.
- Real-time updates of readings on the web page.

## Requirements

-ESP32 development board
- DHT11 Sensor:
- Arduino IDE.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for the ESP32 and DHT sensor. If not, install them using the library manager.
4. Connect the DHT sensor to the appropriate pins on the ESP32.
5. Configure the Wi-Fi credentials in the code to allow the ESP32 to connect to your network.
6. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.
7. Access the ESP32's IP address in a web browser to view the real-time temperature and humidity readings.


## Usage

- Access the ESP32's IP address in a web browser.
- The web page will display the current temperature and humidity readings.
- The readings will update automatically without the need to manually refresh the page.


## Acknowledgements

- you must install the DHT sensor library
